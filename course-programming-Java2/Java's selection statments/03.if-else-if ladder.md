# if-else-if ladder
- The if-else-if ladder looks like :
  ```
  if(condition)
   statement;
  else if(condition)
   statement;
  else if(condition)
   statement;
  .
  .
  .
  else
   statement;
  ```
  - The if statments are executed from top to bottom
  - If any of the if is executed then all the other statments are bypassed
  - if no if is executed then the else statment is executed

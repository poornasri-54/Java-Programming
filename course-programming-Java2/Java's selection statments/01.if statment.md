# if
- The general form of if statment is : <br> if (condition) statement1; <br> else statement2;
- Here a statment can be a single statment or a group of statments enclosed in curly braces
- condition is any expression that returns a boolean value
- The above example tells that if the condition is true statment 1 is executed else(other wise) statment2 is executed
- we need to create a block if we want to execute more than one statment
example :
```
class example1{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int a=2,b=5;
        if(a>b){
            System.out.println("a is greater than b");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("a is less than b");
        }
    }
}
// output : a is less than b
```

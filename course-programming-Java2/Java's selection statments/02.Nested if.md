# Nested if
- In nested if an if statment is a target of another if else statment
- An else in nested if always refers to its nearest if in the same block
```
if(x == 10) {
  if(y < 20) a = b;
  if(z > 100) c = d; // this if is
  else a = c;       // associated with this else
}
else a = d; // this else refers to if(x == 10)
```
- Here else a=d; refers to if(x==10) but not if(y<20)

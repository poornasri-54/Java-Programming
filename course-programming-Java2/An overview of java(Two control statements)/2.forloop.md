# FOR LOOP IN JAVA

Loops in java is a feature used to execute a particular part of the program repeatedly if a given
condition evaluates to be true.
for loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly,and it is recommended only
when the number of iterations are fixed.java for loop provides a concise way of writing the 
loop structure.The for statement consumes the initialization,condition and updation.

Syntax:
```

for(intialization;condition;updation)
{
    //loop of the body
    //the statements we need to execcute 
}
```
# EXPLANATION:
for loop is divided into three parts

1.Intialization:
It is the intial condition and it is executed once when the loop starts.Here we can intialize the variable to some value or we can use already intialized variable 
```
Example:
int i=1;
```
Here we are intializing the variable i with value 1.

2.condition:
It is the second condition.
The body of the loop will execute each time if the given condition is evaluates to be true and goes to the updation.
It continues the execution until the given condition is false.
If the condition is false then it will come out of the for loop.
```
Example:
i<=5;
```
so here the for loop return all the numbers upto 5 once it reach the value 5 then the control comes out of the loop.

3.Updation
when the given condition was true then only the loop enters into the updation. After executing the loop body,this increment or decrement the loop value.
```
Example:
i++;
```
if the intialized value is less than the 5 then the condition is satisfied and i value is going to be incremented.

# INTIALIZATION OF FOR LOOP:
```java
//java program to illustrate a code in for loop
 //Here class is a template used to create objects and to define object datatypes and methods.
class main{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int i;
        // so here we intializing the variable i=1 and given the condition that i should less than or equal to 5 if the condition was true then it will enters into updation and the i value is incremented upto the value 5.
        for(i=1;i<=5;i++)
        {
            System.out.println("java");
            //The i values are going to be printed
            //Here the java is going to be printed 5 times because its checks the condition every time only if the condition was true then the value is updated once the given condition reached to the 6th time the program terminates.
            //println adds the new line after the print text on console
        }
    }

}
```
```

# IF statement in java:

 Decision making in java helps to write decision driven statements and execute a particular set of code based on the certain conditions.
 The java if statement is a most simple decesion making statement.
 The if statement in java works same like the if statement in any other language.
 if statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed,only when the given specified 
 condition is true.If the given condition is not true then the block of the statements will not be executed.

 some relational operators that are used in conditional statements are;
 ```
 .Less than--> x<Y
 .Greater than--> x>y
 .Equal to --> x==y
 ```

# syntax:

```
if(condition)
{
    //if the condition is true then
    //the block of the code is executed
}
```

Here,the condition is a boolean expression.The expression is one either evaluate to true or false.The if statement in java accepts boolean values and if the value is true then it will execute the block of statements under it.

Note:if we doesnot provide the curly braces after the if condition then by default the if statement will consider the immediate one statement to be inside of its block.

# Working of the if statement:
```
1.first the control falls into the if statement.
2.Then the condition as been checked.
 1.if the condition is true then block of code is executed.
 2.if it is false then the control comes out of the if block.
 ```

# INTIAILIZATION OF IF STATEMENT

 Example 1:
 ```java
//java program to illustrate the if statement 
 //Here class is a template used to create objects and to define object datatypes and methods.
class main{
    public stastic void main(String args[])
    {
        int x=10;
        int y=20;
    //Intializing the two variables x and y
        if(x<y)
        {
            System.out.println(" x is smaller than the y");
            //if x is smaller than y then the condition is satisfied the block of the code executed
        }
        System.out.println("outside the if block")
        //both the statements will be printed 
        //println adds the new line after the print text on console
    }

}
```
```
OUTPUT:
x is smaller than the y
outside the if block 
```

EXAMPLE 2:
```java
//java program to illustrate the if statement 
//Here class is a template used to create objects and to define object datatypes and methods
class main{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int x=10;
        int y=20;
        //lets multlipy the variable x with 2
        x=x*2;
        if(x==y)
        {
            System.out.printl("x is equal to y");
            //if x is equal to y then the condition is satisfied the block of the code executed
        }
    }
}
```
```
OUTPUT:
x is equal to y
```

EXAMPLE 3:
```java
//java program to illustrate the if statement 
//Here class is a template used to create objects and to define object datatypes and methods
class main{
    public static void main(String args)
    {
        int x=10;
        int y=20;
        x=x*2;
        if(x>y)
        {
            System.out.println("x is greater than y");
            //The given condition is not true so the block of the code is not executed 
        }
        System.out.println("wont display the message")
        //it comes out the the if block because the condition is not satisfied
     }
}
```
```
OUTPUT:
wont display the message
```

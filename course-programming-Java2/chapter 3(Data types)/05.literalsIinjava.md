## LITERALS

Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called literal/constant. 
In Java, literals are the constant values that appear directly in the program. It can be assigned directly to a variable. In lexical analysis, literals of a given type are generally known as tokens.In simple words, Literals in Java is a synthetic representation of boolean, numeric, character, or string data.

EXAMPLE:
```
int num=1000;
* num-->variable
* 1000-->literal
Here 1000 is  literal because it is constant value that is assigned to the variable num.
```
## Types of Literals in Java

There are the majorly four types of literals in Java:
* Integer Literals
* Floating point Literals
* Character Literals
* Boolean Literals
* String Literals

## Boolean Data Type:

In Java, the boolean keyword is a primitive data type. It is used to store only two possible values, either true or false. It specifies 1-bit of information and its "size" can't be defined precisely.
The boolean keyword is used with variables and methods.This is the type returned by the Relational operators. Its default value is false. It is generally associated with conditional statements.

EXAMPLE:

```java
class booleanexample{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        boolean iseven = true;
        boolean isodd= false;
        System.out.println(iseven);
        System.out.println(isodd);
    }
}
OUTPUT:
true
false
```
## Boolean Expression

A Boolean expression returns a boolean value: true or false.
This is useful to build logic, and find answers.
For example, we can use a comparison operators, such as the less than (<) operator,Equal to(==)operator and greater than (>) operator etc ,to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true or false:

EXAMPLE1:

```
int x = 1;
int y = 10;
System.out.println(x < y); // returns true, because 1 is less than than 10
```

EXAMPLE2:
```
int x = 100;
System.out.println(x == 100); // returns true, because the value of x is equal to 100
```

EXAMPLE3:

```
int x = 1;
int y = 10;
System.out.println(x > y); // returns false, because 1 is not greater than than 10
```

## Initialization Of Boolean Data Type:

```java
public class BooleanExample {  
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
      
        int x=100;  
        int y=20;  
    //  lets consider the boolean values b1 and b2 as true and false    
    boolean b1=true;  
    boolean b2=false;  
  
if(x>y)  
{  
    //returns the boolean value true because 100 is greater than 20
    System.out.println(b1);  
}  
else  
{  
    System.out.println(b2);  
}  
          
    }         
}  
```
OUTPUT:
```
true
```

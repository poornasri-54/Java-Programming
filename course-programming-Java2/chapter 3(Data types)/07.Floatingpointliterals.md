## FLOATING POINT LITERALS

The vales that contain decimal are floating literals. In Java, float and double primitive types fall into floating-point literals.A floating-point literal is of type float if it ends with the letter F or f  otherwise its type is double and it can optionally end with the letter D or d .
For Floating-point data types, we can specify literals in only decimal form, and we cant specify in octal and Hexadecimal forms.

NOTE:By default, every floating-point literal is of double type, and hence we cant assign directly to the float variable. But we can specify floating-point literal as float type by suffixed with f or F. We can specify explicitly floating-point literal as double type by suffixed with d or D

* Floating-point literals for float type end with F or f.
 For example 9f, 8.457F, etc. It is a 32-bit float literal.

 EXAMPLE:
 ```
 Floating:
float height = 155.4f; 
``` 
* Floating-point literals for double type end with D or d. For example, 8d, 6.754D, etc. It is a 64-bit double literal.

EXAMPLE:
```
Decimal:
double interest = 97658.485;  
```
* It can also be represented in the form of the exponent form.

EXAMPLE:
```
Decimal in Exponent form:
double num= 1.432e2;  
```

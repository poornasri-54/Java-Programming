## CHARECTER LITERAL

A character literal is expressed as a character or an escape sequence, enclosed in a single quote ('') mark. It is always a type of char. For example 'b', '%', '\u000d', etc.

For char data types, we can specify literals in 4 ways:

* Single quote: We can specify literal to a char data type as a single character within the single quote.

```
char ch = 'm'
```

* Char literal as Integral literal: we can specify char literal as integral literal, which represents the Unicode value of the character, and that integral literal can be specified either in Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal forms. But the allowed range is 0 to 65535.

```
char ch = 026;
```
* Unicode Representation:The unicode standard uses hexadecimal to express a charecter. We can specify char literals in Unicode representation ‘\uxxxx’. 
Here xxxx represents 4 hexadecimal numbers.
```
char ch = '\u0061';
 Here /u0071 represent a.
 ```

 * Escape Sequence: Every escape character can be specified as char literals.

```
char ch = '\n';
```

* INITIALIZATION OF CHARECTER LITERALS
```java
// Java program to illustrate the
// application of char literals

 class charecterliterals{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
          // single character literal within single quote
        char ch = 'm';
          // It is an Integer literal with octal form
        char a= 0789;
          // Unicode representation
        char b = '\u0061';
       
        System.out.println(ch);
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
       
        // Escape character literal
        System.out.println("\"  is a symbol");
    }
}
```
OUTPUT:
```
m
error:Integer number too large
a
"  is a symbol
```

# INTEGER LITERALS

An integer literal is a numeric value without any fractional or exponential part.

There are 4 types of integer literals in Java:
* Binary (base 2)
* Decimal (base 10)
* Octal (base 8)
* Hexadecimal (base 16)

## Binary Integer
 Binary integer as Base 2, whose digits consists of the numbers 0 and 1.

EXAMPLE:
```
int binVal = 0b10101010;  
Here 0b represents the binary system
```

## Decimal Integer
Decimal integer as Base 10,these are the set of numbers that consist of digits from 0 to 9. It may have a positive (+) digits or negative (-) digits. 
Note that between numbers commas and non-digit characters are not permitted. 
For example 578954,+343,-900 etc.

EXAMPLE:
```
int decval=31;
Here 31 is a decimal integer
```

## Octal Integer
It is a combination of numbers having digits from 0 to 7 with a leading 0.It doesnot include the digits from 8.
 For example 056, 034,071 etc.

 EXAMPLE:
 ```
 int octval=027;
 Here 027 is a octal number because it a combination of digits from 0 to 7 and starting with 0
 ```

 ## Hexadecimal Integer
The sequence of digits preceded by 0x or 0X is considered as hexadecimal integers. It may also include a character from a to f or A to F that represents numbers from 10 to 15, respectively.
 For example 0xd, 0xA etc.

 EXAMPLE:
 ```
 int hexval=0x1b;
 Here 0x represents the hexadecimal system
 ```

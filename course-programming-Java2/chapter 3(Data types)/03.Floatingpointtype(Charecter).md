## Char Data Type:

The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'.A keypoint to understand is that java uses Unicode to represent charecters.The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. Its value-range lies between '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).There are no negetive chars.The standard set charecters known as ASCII still ranges from 0 to 127 as always,and the extended 8 bit charecter set,ISO-Latin-1,ranges from 0 to 255.The char data type is used to store characters.

EXAMPLE:

char myGrade = 'B';

## Initialization Of Char Data Type

```JAVA
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        char myVar1 = 65;
        char myVar2 = 66;
        char myVar3 = 67;
        //(ASCII is a common encoding standard ,which computer use in order to store text based data)
        //Var1=65 is corresponds to the capital A
        System.out.println(myVar1);
        //Var2=66 is corresponds to the capital B
        System.out.println(myVar2);
        //var3=67 is corresponds to the capital c
        System.out.println(myVar3);
    }
}
```
OUTPUT:
```
A
B
C
```

# Type Conversion and Casting

* The process of converting data of one data type into another.
* This process is known as type conversion, typecasting, or even type coercion.
Java allows programmers to convert both primitive as well as reference data types.

For example, it is always possible to assign an int value to a long variable.

However, not all types are compatible. There is no automatic conversion defined from double to byte. To do these types of conversions we use casting.

* Explicit conversion between incompatible types is called type casting.

An important point to remember is, While conversion of one type to another data type only the type of a variable will be changed not the value of a variable.

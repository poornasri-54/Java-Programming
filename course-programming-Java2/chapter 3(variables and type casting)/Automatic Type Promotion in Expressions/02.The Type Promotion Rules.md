# The Promotion in Expressions

Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions

* They are as follows: First, all byte, short, and char values are promoted to int.
* if one operand is a long, the whole expression is promoted to long.
* If one operand is a float, the entire expression is promoted to float.
* If any of the operands are double, the result is double.

class Promote {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    byte b = 42;
    char c = 'a';
    short s = 1024;
    int i = 50000;
    float f = 5.67f;
    double d = .1234;
    double result = (f * b) + (i / c) - (d * s);
    System.out.println((f * b) + " + " + (i / c) + " - " + (d * s));
    System.out.println("result = " + result);
    }
}

The type promotions that occur in this line from the program:
double result = (f * b) + (i / c) - (d * s);

* Here, the subexpressinon **(f * b)** type is assigned as **float**, as **b** is promoted to **float**. 

* The subexpression **(i / c)** is  **int** type, as **c** is promoted to **int**.

* The subexpression **(d * s)** is **double**, as **s** is promoted to **double**.

Finally, these three intermediate values, float, int, and double, are considered.

* now, float plus int is promoted to **float** and then **float** minus double is promoted to **double**.Therefor,the final type of the expression is **double**

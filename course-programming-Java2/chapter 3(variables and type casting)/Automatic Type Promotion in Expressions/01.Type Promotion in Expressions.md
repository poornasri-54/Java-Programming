# Automatic Type Promotion in Expressions

when incompatable data type conversion occur we will use casting. But what if we find these kind of data types in expressions
where certain narrowing conversions may occur:

The process of automatically promoting smaller data types to larger data types in an expression is type promotion in expression.

```
byte a = 40;
byte b = 50;
byte c = 100;
int d = a * b / c;
```

The result of the intermediate term a * b easily exceeds the range of either of its byte operands. To handle this kind of problem, Java automatically promotes each byte, short, or char operand to int when evaluating an expression.
As useful as the automatic promotions are, they can cause confusing compile-time
errors.For example, this seemingly correct code causes a problem:

```
byte b = 50;
b = b * 2;
```

In the code 50*2 is perfectly valid byte value and stores in byte variable. because the operands were automatically promoted to int when the expression was evaluated,the result also evaluated in int. so, Now the expression is in int, which cannot assigned to byte, as the int is larger than byte.

* In these type of case we will use general casting form that is
(target-type)value

```
byte b = 50;
b = (byte)(b * 2);
```

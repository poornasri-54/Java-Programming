# Introducing Type Inference with Local Variables
- In java with respect to variables a variable first need to be declared and then initialized and a varible can also be initialized when it is declared
- The type of initializer must be the same as the type when it is declared
- From the above statment it would not be necessary to explicitly declare the variable as initializer infers to the type of the variable. But this is not the case in java till now
- Now it is possible to let the complier to infer to the type by the initializer
- To support local variable type inference, the context sensitive keyword **var** is being introduced
- To attain local varianle inference a variable must be declared with var as the type and must include an initializer
- double sum = 12.0; is same as var sum = 12.0;
- As var tells the compiler to infer to the datatype based on the initializer it is a placeholder for the actual data type
- var myarray = new int[10]; is valid where as <br> var[] myarray = new int[10]; is invalid and <br> var myvar[] = new int[10] is also invalid
- We cannot just declare a variable with var we must initialize while declaring
- var myvar; is invalid
- We cannot use for declaring instance variables , parametrs or return type
# Some var restrictions 
- only one varibale can be declared at a time
- A variable can not use none as an initializer
- A variable being declared cannot be used as an initializer expression
- we cannot use var with an array initializer
- var cannot be used as the name of a class
- we cannot use the local variable type to declare the exception type caught by a catch statment
- we cannot use lambda expressions or method references as initializers

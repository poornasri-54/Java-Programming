# A closure look at the first program
```
/*first sample java program with the class name sample*/
class sample{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        //this is to print anoutputt on the console
        System.out.println("This is our first sample java program");
    }
}
```
- **comments**
  - The above example starts with <br> '/*first sample java program with the class name sample*/' which is called a comment
  - These comments are ignored at the time of compilation
  - Comments are used to make it easy to understand the code to any reader
  - The above comment tells that this is a sample program written with the class name sample
  - There are three types of comments
     - a multiline comment which is used above, where the comment starts with '/*' and ends with '*/' here the comment can be written in any number of lines
     - single line comment which starts with '//' here a comment of only one line can be written
     - documentation comment which is used to a HTML file that documents a program
- **class**
  - The next line of the program is class sample{
  - The keyword class is used to declare that a new class is defined
  - The word sample is an identifier which is the class name
  - The class definition and the members of the class are defined within the opening curly brace '{' and the closing curly brace '}'
- **public static void main(string[] args){**
   - This line begins with the main method
   - **public**
      - public keyword is an access modifier. It controls the visibility of class members
      - public keyword describes that its class members can be accessed by code outside the class
    - **static**
       - The keyword static is used to call main without instantiating the instance of the class
       - It is necessary because the main is to be called before any objects are initialized
    - **void**
       - void is used to tell that the main method does not return any value
    - **main**
       - main is the method called when a Java application begins
       - java compiler will compile  all classes even without the main but these classes can not run without the main
    - **String[] args**
       - every method has a set of parameters within the parenthesis. eveb if there are no parameters still we need to include empty paranthesis
       - main method has one parameter which is String[] args
       - args is an array of instances of the class String
       - args receives any command-line arguments present when the program is executed
    - **{**
       - '{' states that it is the start of the main method
       - main  method ends with '}'
- **System.out.println("This is our first sample java program");**
   - output is accomplished by the builtin println() method. it is used to display the strings passed to it
   - the line starts with System.out. where System is a predefined class that gives access to the system and out is an output stream that is connected to the console
   - println() prints the given string followed by a next line

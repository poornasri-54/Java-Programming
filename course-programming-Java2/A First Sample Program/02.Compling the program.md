# Compiling the program
- To compile a java program we have to execute the compiler with its source code name on the command line as <br> `c:\javac file_name.java`
- The javac compiler then creates a file called file_name.class , this class contains the java bytecode which is the intermediate representation of the program which contains instructions the java virtual machine executes.
- To run the program we must use the java application launcher called java with the file name as `c:\>java file_name` The output will be displayed after this.
- Each class is put into its respective output file named with its class name with the extension .class
- This is the reason why we save the file name with the name of the main class.

# Entering the program
- In many computer programming languages the name of the file with the source code is chosen irrespective of the program.
- But in java the name of the file with the source code is very particular.
- In java name of the file should be the same as the name of the main class.
- For example if the file name is sample.java , the main class should be sample.
- This convention is used to maintain and organize your programs.
- Java is case sensitive it is important to notice capitals.

# The ? Operator 

- Java includes a special ternary (three-way) operator that can replace certain types of if-then
else statements.

- expression1 ? expression2 : expression3

- Here, expression1 can be any expression that evaluates to a boolean value. If expression1 is true, then expression2 is evaluated; otherwise, expression3 is evaluated. The result of the ? operation is that of the expression evaluated. Both expression2 and expression3 are required to return the same (or compatible) type, which canâ€™t be void.

- The meaning of ternary is composed of three parts. The ternary operator (? :) consists of three operands. It is used to evaluate Boolean expressions. The operator decides which value will be assigned to the variable. It is the only conditional operator that accepts three operands. It can be used instead of the if-else statement. It makes the code much more easy, readable, and shorter.

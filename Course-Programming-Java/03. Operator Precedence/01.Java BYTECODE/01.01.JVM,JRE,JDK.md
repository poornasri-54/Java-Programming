## Java Virtual Machine:
- Java virtual machine(JVM) loads, verifies and executes Java Bytecode.
- The JVM performs:
    - Loads code
    - Verifies code
    - Executes Code
## Java Runtime Environment(JRE):
- The JRE is the technology that communicates between the program and operating system.
- A Runtime Environment provides access to memory and system resources such as files etc,.
- It acts as a translator and facilitator, providing the resources so that the java program runs on any operating system without further modifications.
## Java Development Kit(JDK):
- JDK is a bunch of sofware development tools and supportinf libraries combined with the Java Runtime Environment(JRE) and Java Virtual Machine(JVM).
- JDK contains a private JVm and other resources like interpreter, compiler, archiver, a documentation generator etc. to complete the development of Java Application.

# Operator Precedence 

- The operator precedence represents how two expressions are bind together. In an expression, it determines the grouping of operators with operands and decides how an expression will evaluate.
- While solving an expression two things must be kept in mind the first is a precedence and the second is associativity.

# Java Operator Precedence Table

| Precedence | Operator | Type | Associativity |
| ----------- | -------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 15 | (),[],. | Parentheses,Array subscript,Member selection | Left to Right | 
| 14 | ++,-- | Unary post-increment,Unary post-decrement | Right to Left |
| 13 | ++,--,+,-,!,~,(type) | Unary pre-increment,Unary pre-decrement,Unary plus,Unary minus,Unary logical negation,Unary bitwise complement,Unary type cast | Right to Left |
| 12 | *,/,% | Multiplication,Division,Modulus | Left to Right |
| 11 | +,- | Addition,Subtraction | Left to Right |
| 10 | <<,>>,>>> | Bitwise left shift,Bitwise right shift with sign extension,Bitwise right shift with zero extension | Left to Right | 
| 9 | <,<=,>,>=,instanceof | Relational less than,Relational less than or equal,Relational greater than,Relational greater than or equal,Type comparison (objects only) | Left to Right |
| 8 | ==,!= | Relational is equal to,Relational is not equal to | Left to Right |
| 7 | & | Bitwise AND | Left to Right |
| 6 | ^ | Bitwise exclusive OR | Left to Right |
| 5 | l | Bitwise inclusive OR | Left to right |
| 4 | && | Logical AND | Left to Right |
| 3 | ll | Logical OR | Left to Right |
| 2 | ? : | Ternary conditional | Right to left |
| 1 | =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%= | Assignment,Addition assignment,Subtraction assignment,Multiplication assignment,Division assignment,Modulus assignment | Right to left | 


## Java Operator Precedence Example

- Let's understand the operator precedence through an example. 
- 1 + 5 * 3 
- The multiplication (*) operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.Therefore, the answer will be 16.

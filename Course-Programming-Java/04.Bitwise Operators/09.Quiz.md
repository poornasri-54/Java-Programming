## Q) Which of these statements are incorrect?
    a) The left shift operator, <<, shifts all of the bits in a value to the left specified number of times
    b) The right shift operator, >>, shifts all of the bits in a value to the right specified number of times
    c) The left shift operator can be used as an alternative to multiplying by 2

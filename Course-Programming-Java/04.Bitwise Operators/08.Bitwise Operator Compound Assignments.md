## Bitwise Operator Compound Assignments

- All of the binary bitwise operators have a compound form similar to that of the algebraic operators, which combines the assignment with the bitwise operation. For example, the following two statements, which shift the value in a right by four bits, are equivalent:
```
a = a >> 4;
a >>= 4;
```
- Likewise, the following two statements, which result in a being assigned the bitwise expression a OR b, are equivalent:
```
a = a | b;
a |= b;
```

## Program 

```
class OpBitEquals {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 int a = 1;
 int b = 2;
 int c = 3;
 a |= 4;
 b >>= 1;
 c <<= 1;
 a ^= c;
 System.out.println("a = " + a);
 System.out.println("b = " + b);
 System.out.println("c = " + c);
 }
}
```

```
The output of this program is shown here:
 a = 3
 b = 1
 c = 6
```

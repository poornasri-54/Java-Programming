## Right Shift Operator

- The right shift operator, >>, shifts all of the bits in a value to the right a specified number of times. Its general form is shown here:
    - value >> num
- Here, num specifies the number of positions to right-shift the value in value. That is, the >> moves all of the bits in the specified value to the right the number of bit positions specified by num.
- The following code fragment shifts the value 32 to the right by two positions, resulting in a being set to 8:
```
int a = 32;
a = a >> 2; // a now contains 8
```
- Looking at the same operation in binary shows more clearly how this happens:
```
a=00100011 =35
a>>2
after right shift 00001000 = 8
```
- Each time you shift a value to the right, it divides that value by twoâ€”and discards any remainder.
```
Example
If x=10, then calculate x>>2 value.

Shifting the value of x towards the right two positions will make the rightmost 2 bits to be lost. The value of x is 10. The binary representation of 10 is 00001010. The procedure to do right shift explained in the following example:

Observe the above example, after shifting the bits to the right the binary number 00001010 (in decimal 10) becomes 00000010 (in decimal 2).

## Program 

```
// Java Program to Illustrate Signed Right Shift Operator
 
// Main class
class GFG {
 
    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
 
        int x = -4;
        System.out.println(x >> 1);
 
        int y = 4;
        System.out.println(y >> 1);
    }
}
```

```
Output
-2
2

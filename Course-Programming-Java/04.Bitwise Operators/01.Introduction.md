# Bitwise Operators

## Introduction

- Bitwise operators are used to perform the manipulation of individual bits of a number.
- Java defines several bitwise operators that can be applied to the integer types: long, int, short, char, and byte. These operators act upon the individual bits of their operands.They are summarized in the following table :

| Operation | Operator |
| --------- | -------- |
| Bitwise unary NOT | ~ |
| Bitwise AND | & |
| Bitwise OR |||
| Bitwise Exclusive OR | ^ |
| Shift Right | >> |
| Shift Left | << |
| Shift right zero fill | >>> |
| Bitwise AND assignment | &= |
| Bitwise OR assignment ||= | 
| Bitwise exclusive OR assignment | ^= |
| Shift right assignment | >>= |
| Shift left assignment | <<= |
| Shift right zero fill assignment | >>>= |

- All of the integer types are represented by binary numbers of varying bit widths. For example, the byte value for 42 in binary 
is 00101010, where each position represents a power of two, starting with 2^0 at the rightmost bit.
- All of the integer types (except char) are signed integers. This means that they can represent negative values as well as positive ones. 
- Java uses an encoding known as two’s complement, which means that negative numbers are represented by inverting (changing 1’s 
to 0’s and vice versa) all of the bits in a value, then adding 1 to the result.
- Because Java uses two’s complement to store negative numbers—and because all integers are signed values in Java—applying the bitwise operators can easily produce unexpected results.

## Left Shift Operator

- The left shift operator, <<, shifts all of the bits in a value to the left a specified number of times. It has this general form:
    - value << num
- Here, num specifies the number of positions to left-shift the value in value. That is, the << moves all of the bits in the specified value to the left by the number of bit positions specified by num. For each shift left, the high-order bit is shifted out (and lost), and a zero is brought in on the right.
```
Example
If x=10, then calculate x<<2 value.

Shifting the value of x towards the left two positions will make the leftmost 2 bits to be lost. The value of x is 10. The binary representation of 10 is 00001010. The procedure to do left shift explained in the following example:

Observe the above example, after shifting the bits to the left the binary number 00001010 (in decimal 10) becomes 00101000 (in decimal 40).
```

## Example program 

```
// Left shifting a byte value.
class ByteShift {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 byte a = 64, b;
 int i;
 i = a << 2;
 b = (byte) (a << 2);
 System.out.println("Original value of a: " + a);
 System.out.println("i and b: " + i + " " + b);
 }
}
```
```
The output generated by this program is shown here:
 Original value of a: 64
 i and b: 256 0
```

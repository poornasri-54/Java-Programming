# Bitwise Logical Operators 

- The bitwise logical operators are &, |, ^, and ~. The following table shows the outcome of each operation.

| Operator | Operator | Operator | Operator | Operator | Operator |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| A | B | A OR B | A&B | A^B | ~A |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

## The Bitwise NOT

- Also called the bitwise complement, the unary NOT operator, ~, inverts all of the bits of its operand. For example, the number 42, which has the following bit pattern:
    00101010 
    becomes 11010101 after the NOT operator is applied.

## The Bitwise AND

- The AND operator, &, produces a 1 bit if both operands are also 1. A zero is produced in all 
other cases. Here is an example:
    | Binary | Integer |
    | ------ | ------- |
    |  00101010 | 42 |
    | &00001111 |  15 |
    | Ans:00001010 | 10 |

## The Bitwise OR

- The OR operator, |, combines bits such that if either of the bits in the operands is a 1, then the resultant bit is a 1, as shown here:
    | Binary | Integer |
    | ------ | ------- |
    |  00101010 | 42 |
    |  00001111 | 15 | 
    | Ans :00101111 | 47 |

## The Bitwise XOR

- The XOR operator, ^, combines bits such that if exactly one operand is 1, then the result is 1. Otherwise, the result is zero. The following example shows the effect of the ^. This example also demonstrates a useful attribute of the XOR operation. Notice how the bit pattern of 42 is inverted wherever the second operand has a 1 bit. Wherever the second operand has a 0 bit, the first operand is unchanged. You will find this property useful when performing some types of bit manipulations.
    | Binary | Integer |
    | ------ | ------- |
    |  00101010 | 42 |
    |  ^00001111 | 15 |
    | Ans :00100101 | 37 |

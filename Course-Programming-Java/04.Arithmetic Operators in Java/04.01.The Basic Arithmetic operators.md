# Arithmetic Operators
- Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra.
- The operands of the arithmetic operators must be of a numeric type. You cannot use them on boolean types, but you can use them on char types, since the char type in Java is, essentially, a subset of int.

## Operators in Java
|Operator|Operation|
|--------|---------|
| + | Addition (also unary plus) |
| – | Subtraction (also unary minus) |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| % | Modulus |
| ++ | Increment |
| += | Addition assignment |
| –= | Subtraction assignment |
| *= | Multiplication assignment |
| /= | Division assignment |
| %= | Modulus assignment |
| – – | Decrement |

- The unary minus operator negates its single operand. 
- The unary minus operator negates its single operand.
- when the division operator is applied to an integer type, there will be no fractional component attached to the result.

- **Example program demonstrating the Arthmetic operators**

``` java
// Demonstrate the basic arithmetic operators.
class BasicMath {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // arithmetic using integers
    System.out.println("Integer Arithmetic");
    int a = 1 + 1;
    int b = a * 3;
    int c = b / 4;
    int d = c - a;
    int e = -d;
    System.out.println("a = " + a);
    System.out.println("b = " + b);
    System.out.println("c = " + c);
    System.out.println("d = " + d);
    System.out.println("e = " + e);
    // arithmetic using doubles
    System.out.println("\nFloating Point Arithmetic");
    double da = 1 + 1;
    double db = da * 3;
    double dc = db / 4;
    double dd = dc - a;
    double de = -dd;
    System.out.println("da = " + da);
    System.out.println("db = " + db);
    System.out.println("dc = " + dc);
    System.out.println("dd = " + dd);
    System.out.println("de = " + de);
    }
}
```
- **Output**
```
Integer Arithmetic
 a = 2
 b = 6
 c = 1
 d = -1
 e = 1
Floating Point Arithmetic
 da = 2.0
 db = 6.0
 dc = 1.5
 dd = -0.5
 de = 0.5
```

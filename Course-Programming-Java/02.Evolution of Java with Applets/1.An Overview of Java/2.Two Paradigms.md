# Two paradigms
All computer progams consist of two elements called **data** and
**code**.


Futhermore. a progam can be conceputally organized around its **code**
or around its **data**.  


That is, some programs are written around "**what is happend**" and
others are wrutten around **"who is being affected"**.
These are the two paradigms that govern how a progam os construced:
* 1.Process-oriented model/structed progamming/ top-down programming
* 2.Object-oriented programming/ bottom-up desing.
Process-oriented apporach characterizer a program as series of **linear steps
(that is ,code). The process-oriented model can be thought of as
**code acting on data**


## procedural  languages such as c
* Object-oriented programming organizes a program aroud its data(that is,object)
and a set of well-defined interfaces of the data.
An obhect-oriented program can be characterized as **data controlling
access to code**


## OOP languages such as java

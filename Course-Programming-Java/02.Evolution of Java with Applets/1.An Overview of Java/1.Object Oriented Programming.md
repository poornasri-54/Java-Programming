# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
**object** mean in real world entity called book,pen,chair etc
mean the entity which has state and behavior called an object.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that
organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions 
and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique 
attributes and behavior.



Object oriented progamming follows a bottom-up approach and also it divided
tha progam into small parts called object.The oops is a platform independent 
language and it has some access specifiers like public,private and protected
and also oops giv us more security.



Oops is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance,data binding,
polymorphism etc.Smaltalk is considered as the frist truly object oriented 
programming language.object oriented programming is a methodology to desidn
a program using classes and objects.The software concepts that are provided
they are:
* **Class**
* **Object**
* **Inheritance**
* **polymorphism**
* **Abstraction**
* **Encapsulation**

# Interger
In Java, an integer is a whole number that does not have a fractional or decimal part then it is known as interger. There are four primary data types for representing integers in Java:
* int
* byte
* long
* short
* int: The int data type is a 32-bit signed integer. It can represent whole numbers ranging from approximately -2 billion to +2 billion (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).

* long: The long data type is a 64-bit signed integer. It can represent larger whole numbers, with a range from approximately -9 quintillion to +9 quintillion (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807).

|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| long     |    64           |  -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807    |                              
| short    |    16           |      -32,768 to 32,767                                      |
| int      |    32           |     -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| byte     |    8            |      -128 to 127                                            |

* Here we know that 1byte=4bits

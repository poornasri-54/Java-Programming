# short
In Java, a short is a primitive data type that represents a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a range of -32,768 to 32,767. Shorts are commonly used when memory space is limited or when working with data that falls within this range.

* It's important to note that shorts are less commonly used compared to other integer types like int or long in Java. This is primarily because modern computers have efficient memory management, making the optimization benefits of using shorts less significant.

```java
public class ShortExample
 {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        //we are giving short values to the variables
        short a = 10;
        short b = 20;
        // Performing addition and casting the result to short
        short sum = (short) (a + b); 
        //printing the sum as result
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        //giving max and min values         
        short max = Short.MAX_VALUE;
        short min = Short.MIN_VALUE;
        //priting the max and min values in the resullt
        System.out.println("Maximum value: " + max);
        System.out.println("Minimum value: " + min);
    }
}
```
* output
30
Maximum value:32762
Minimum value:-32768

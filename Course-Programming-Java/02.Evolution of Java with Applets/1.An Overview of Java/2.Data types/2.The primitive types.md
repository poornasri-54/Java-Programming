# The primitive types
In Java, primitive types are the most basic data types available in the language. They are used to represent simple values and are not objects. There are eight primitive types in Java:
* byte
* short 
* int
* long
* boolean
* range
* float
* double
This are the eight primitive data type in java
* boolean: Represents a boolean value, either true or false.

* byte: Represents a signed 8-bit integer value. It has a range of -128 to 127.

* short: Represents a signed 16-bit integer value. It has a range of -32,768 to 32,767.

* int: Represents a signed 32-bit integer value. It has a range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

* long: Represents a signed 64-bit integer value. It has a range of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. To specify a long literal, you can append an 'L' or 'l' at the end of the value.

* float: Represents a single-precision 32-bit floating-point value. It can represent fractional numbers. To specify a float literal, you can append an 'F' or 'f' at the end of the value.

* double: Represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point value. It value range is unlimited. By default, decimal literals with a decimal point are treated as double.

* char: Represents a single Unicode character.
Here this eight data types are classified into some data types like
* Integer - int,byte,short,range,long
* floating point - double,float
* character - char
* boolean - boolean

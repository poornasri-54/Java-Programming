# int
The **int** data type in Java is a 32-bit signed integer, which means it occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory. It can represent whole numbers ranging from approximately -2 billion to +2 billion. The specific range is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
* If you declare an **int** variable without initializing it, it will be assigned a default value of 0.
* We can also  perform various arithmetic operations on **int** values, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder). The result of any arithmetic operation involving **int** values will also be an int.
```java
class test
{
    public static void main(String,arg[]);
    {
        //here we are giving float values to the variables
        int a=10;
        int b=20;
        //printing the result  
        System.out.println(a+b);
    }
}
```
* output

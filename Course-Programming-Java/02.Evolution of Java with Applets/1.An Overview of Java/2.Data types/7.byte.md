# byte
In Java, byte is a primitive data type that represents an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It can store values in the range of -128 to 127.
* **byte** is often used when working with low-level data, file operations, or in cases where memory efficiency is crucial, such as when reading data from streams or files byte by byte.
 
```java
byte myByte;                   // Declaration
byte myByte = 10;              // Declaration and initialization
```

* It's important to note that **byte** is less commonly used compared to other integer types such as **int** or **long** in most general-purpose programming scenarios. However, it is frequently utilized in specialized cases that require memory optimization or handling raw binary data.

```java
public class byte
{

     public static void main(String []args)
     {
         byte a=10;
         byte b=20;
         byte c=30;
        System.out.println(a*b*c);
     }
}
```

# Java is strongly typed language

Java is considered a strongly typed language because it enforces strict type checking at compile-time. In a strongly typed language like Java, each variable and expression must have a specific data type, and the type of a variable is checked before performing any operations on it.
* Here the user canot create a variable without the range of values it can hold.And once if we declared the data type we can change it again.
* The Java compiler checks all expressions and parameters to ensure that the types are compatible. Any type mismatches are errors that must be corrected before the compiler will finish compiling the class.

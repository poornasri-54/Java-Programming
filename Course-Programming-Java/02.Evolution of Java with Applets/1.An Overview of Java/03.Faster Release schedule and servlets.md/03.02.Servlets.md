## Servlets
- A servlet is a java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model.
- Client side code is just one half of the client/server equation.
-  Java would also be useful on the server side.
- Servlets are used to create dynamically generated content that is then served to the client.
- Servlets are highly portable as these are compiled into bytecode and executed by the JVM.
- The servlet offered several advantages, including increased performance even though dynamically generated content was available through mechanisms such as CGI (Common Gateway Interface).
- Server-side code constitutes a major use of Java.

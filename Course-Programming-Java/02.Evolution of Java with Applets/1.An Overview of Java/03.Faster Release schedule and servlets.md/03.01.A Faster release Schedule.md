## A Faster Release Schedule
- It relates to the way that Java releases are scheduled.
- Major Java releases were typically separated by two or more years.
- It allows Java to respond quickly to the demands of an ever-changing programming environment.
- Today, it is anticipated that a major release will occur on a strict time-based schedule, with the expected time between such releases being just six months.
- Each six month release is called a Feature Release.
- At three year itervals, a long-term support(LTS) release will take place.
- The first LTS release was JDK 11.
- The second LTS release was JDK 17.
- Feature releases are scheduled for March and September of each year. As a result, JDK 10 was released in March 2018, which was six months after the release of JDK 9.The next release (JDK 11) was in September 2018.
- JDK 11 was an an LTS release.
- Then JDK 12 was released in March 2019, JDK 13 in september 2019 and so on.
- The latest release, JDK 17 is an LTS release.

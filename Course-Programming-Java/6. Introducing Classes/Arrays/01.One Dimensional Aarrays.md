# One-Dimensional Arrays
- One-Dimensional Array is a list like-typed variables referred by a common name
- we must first create a array variable of required type
- general form of a One-Dimensional array declaration is:<br>`type[] varname;`
- type describes the type of data the array will hold
- example : `int[] even_nums;`
- Here even_nums is an array of elements of data type int
- Above declaration tells that even_nums is an  array of type int but array actually doesnt exist
- For the array to actually exist we must allocate the array some space using the keyword **new** . we also have to declare the size of the array.
- The general method of allocating memory to the array is : <br>`array-name = new datatype[size]`
- size determines the number of elements in the array
- Initially after declaration every element of the array is initialized to zero or null or false
- Elements of array are accessed by its indexes within square brackets
- Every array starts with index zero
- example : `even_nums[4]=10;`
- `System.out.println(even_nums[4]);`
- The above line displays the value stored at index 4 i.e, 10
```
  //Demonstration of One Dimensional Array
  class Array{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    //declaring an array even_nums
    int[] even_nums;
    even_nums = new int[10];
    even_nums[0]=2;
    even_nums[1]=4;
    even_nums[2]=6;
    even_nums[3]=8;
    even_nums[4]=10;
    even_nums[5]=12;
    even_nums[6]=14;
    even_nums[7]=16;
    even_nums[8]=18;
    even_nums[9]=20;
    System.out.println("Fifth even number is:"+even_nums[4]);
  }
}
```
```
Output : Fifth even number is: 10
```
- we can combine declaration and allocation of memory by <br> int[] even_nums = new int[10]
- Arrays can also be initialized when they are declared and there is no need of using new keyword
```
class AutoArray {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] even_nums={2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20};
        System.out.println("Fifth even number is:"+even_nums[4]);
    }
}
```
```
output : Fifth even number is: 10
``` 
- Java also checks to make sure that we do not even accidentally try to store or refer to the values out of range

# Multidimensional Array
- Multidimensional Arrays are arrays of arrays
- To declare a multidimensional array we need to specify every additional index using an additional square brackets
- Two dimensional array is called as a twoD array
- example of declaring a twoD array : int[][] twoD = new int[4][5]
- In a twoD array each element is numbered from left to right and top to bottom
- When we allocate the memory for multidimensional array we first need to specify the leftmost dimension , the rest can be allocated separatly
- In [m][n] left index 'm' determines row and right index 'n' determines coloumn
- The following example declares the left most index first and the rest are are declared further
      int[][] twoD = new int[4][];
      twoD[0] = new int[1];
      twoD[1] = new int[2];
      twoD[2] = new int[3];
      twoD[3] = new int[4];
- Like one dimensional array multidimensional arrays can also be initialized at the time of declaratoin by using curly braces for every inner array
- We can also use expressions and literal values inside of array initializers
- We can also declare arrays in other way like :<br> ` int twoD1[][] = new int[4][5]`
